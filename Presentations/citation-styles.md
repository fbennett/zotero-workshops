#What we will learn this session
* Zotero's citation styles are written in CSL - Citation Style Language
* While there are 700 styles covering almost 3000 publications, users frequently ask for specific journals or would like small adjustments to style for their own use
* We will learn how to use a visual editor for CSL to 
		+ identify existing citation styles that resemble specifications
		+ adjust those citation styles

#Brief history of CSL
* Developed by Bruce D'Arcus 
* First Included in Zotero in 2006
* Major Update to CSL 1.0 in 2010
* Since then, adopted by Mendeley, Papers2, Quiqqa and other
* Several Open Source processors for CSL, including citeproc-js, used in Zotero and Mendeley, written \& maintained by Frank Bennett
* Project hosted at citationstyles.org, maintained principally by Rintze Zelle

#Advantages of CSL
* Open source
* Seamless switching between citation formats
* \<group\> feature for complex formatting and missing fields
* \<macro\> for efficient coding
* \<choose\> conditionals
* Multilingual

#Currently not supported in CSL
* Alphanumerical styles used in Math and Computer Science

* Limited support for journal abbreviations

#Basic structure of a CSL style
* CSL is an XML language - it looks a lot like html. Like webpages, CSL styles are built up of nested nodes.
* `<style>` The parent of all other nodes. contains basic info and "global" options such as default language
* `<info>` section contains name of style and other identifiers
* `<macro>` multiple macros that define recurring parts of the style (optional but useful)
* `<citation>` defines the format for the in-text citation (required)
* `<bibliography>` defines the bibliography (optional, but almos always required).

#Key CSL elements
* `<text>` prints something - a var	iable, a macro, etc.
* `<choose>` begins a conditional: if --> then. Requires `<if>` as a child
* `<names>` and `<date>` get special treatment
* `<group>` groups several elements together.
* `<label>` prints a label - such as "pp." for a variable
* prefix, suffix, delimiter - determine what happens between items.

#Using the Visual Editor#
* Core Idea: Do as little editing as possible
* Use the "search by example" function, especially the "book chapter" item type.

#Let's write some citation styles!!!
